The repository of Alex LeClerc's personal portfolio website

## TO DO
- [ ] add images (photos, project images) to index.html
- [ ] hyperlink at the bottom of each section to redirect to full page
- [x] add SVG stripe graphic to div container borders
- [x] make stripe dynamic depending on how many divs on the page there are 
  - right now it just sends the bottom stripe go off to the right by default
    - if there are an even number of divs on a page, the stripe should come from the left at the top and leave at the right at the bottom
    - if there are an odd number, the stripe should come from the right at the top and leave at the left on the bottom
